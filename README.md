🐑 Sheep Single-Cell Atlas
This repository contains the analysis code, scripts, and workflows used to construct and analyze the Sheep Single-Cell Atlas, a high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) resource spanning 15 major tissues, including reproductive, neuroendocrine, immune, and metabolic systems.
The atlas comprises >1 million cells profiled using droplet-based scRNA-seq, enabling the characterization of cell-type-specific transcriptional programs, developmental trajectories, and cross-species conservation with humans.
